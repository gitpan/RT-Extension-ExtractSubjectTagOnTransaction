SUMMARY ---

RT-Extension-ExtractSubjectTag is an extension for use when you have
multiple RT systems (or other automated systems) talking to each
other.  All the systems need to use some sort of subject based tag to
track things.

RT figures out which ticket a message is associated with by looking
for a [rtname #1234] or similar tag in the Subject line.  If multiple
RT instances are sharing a ticket, it needs to contain a tag for each
RT system.

This extension looks at incoming messages and modifies the subject of
the ticket to include any appropriate rtnames (or other tags) from other systems.

INSTALLATION ---

To install the extension:

$ perl Makefile.PL

(it may prompt you for the path to your RT.pm, if it can't
automatically detect it.)

$ make
$ make install

Before the Scrip will actually work, you must run:

$ make initdb

which will create a new global scrip:

  Description: On transaction, add any tags in the transaction's subject 
               to the ticket's subject
  Condition: On Transaction
  Action: ExtractSubjectTag
  Template: Blank
  Stage: TransactionCreate

In order to prevent the other RT instance's auto-response to your RT's resolve
message from re-opening your resolved ticket, any RT instance you will be 
interacting with needs to have the header

  RT-Control: no-autoopen

included in its default resolve template.  Note that this will only work in
RT 3.4.2 and later.  To make the RT-Control: header work in earlier versions of
RT, you need to apply the following patch to lib/RT/Action/AutoOpen.pm (the
patch file is also included as etc/no-autoopen.patch in this distribution).  
Note that the second line which the patch adds wraps to include 
'=~ /\bno-autoopen\b/i )'.

CONFIGURATION ---

ExtractSubjectTag supports two configuration directives.

$ExtractSubjectTagMatch - a regular expression that describes what
tags shouuld be extracted from the subject line.  

Defaults to: /\[.+? #\d+\]/ which will match any RT system.

Other examples:

  Set($ExtractSubjectTagMatch, qr/\#\d+/ );
  Match a # followed by a number.

  Set($ExtractSubjectTagMatch, qr/\[(?:pizza|fred|noodle) #\d+\]/  
  Match tickets from systems with rtnames pizza, fred, or noodle.

$ExtractSubjectTagNoMatch - a regular expression that describes tags
that might match $ExtractSubjectTagMatch, but shouldn't be included.
The rtname of the current system is an example of this.  Defaults to:
qr/\[(?:${RT::EmailSubjectTagRegex}) #\d+\]/;  You only want to change
this if you add something to your ExtractSubjectTagMatch that you
don't want to get added to your subject.
